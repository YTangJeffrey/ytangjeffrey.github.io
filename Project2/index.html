                <h2>WASHINGTON—Affirming the importance of traditions like Columbus Day to other Americans, the nation’s
                    573
                    federally recognized Indian nations released a joint statement Monday confirming they don’t need a
                    special holiday and would be perfectly fine with just having large swaths of land returned to them
                    immediately. “Look, we get why Christopher Columbus is very important to some people, and we’re more
                    than willing to compromise so long as the U.S. government returns 1.5 billion acres of land to us as
                    soon as they can,” said Chief Harold Longtoe Ouimette, 63, an Abenaki elder who confirmed that
                    although marching in a parade honoring Native peoples might be interesting, the group of indigenous
                    tribes would vastly prefer if U.S. residents could just vacate Manhattan, the Black Hills, and
                    thousands of other
                    sites taken from them through broken treaties, coercion, and violence. “Obviously, honoring someone
                    who
                    caused a mass genocide is still troubling, but we’re seriously open to letting that slide if we get
                    back, say, the continent that you stole from us. That or $35 trillion. Your choice, honestly.” At
                    press
                    time, the U.S. government had responded to the Native peoples’ request with an offer of $5 in lump
                    silver per person and a box of the finest cloth ever purveyed in Europe.</h2>

                    kind who would have killed or enslaved them—they survived because of us. We

                    T’Gatoi whipped her three meters of body off her couch, toward the door, and out at full speed. She
                    had bones—ribs, a long spine, a skull, four sets of limb bones per segment. But when she moved that
                    way, twisting, hurling herself into controlled falls, landing running, she seemed not only boneless,
                    but aquatic—something swimming through the air as though it were water. I loved watching her move.

                    Side
                </h3>

                <h2>When Activision first released Call Of Duty: Mobile early this month, fans were psyched to have the
                    iconic first-player shooter optimized for Android and iPhone. Now it looks like there’s even more to
                    get
                    excited about, because the developers just revealed that an upcoming update for the game will only
                    allow
                    players on the American side to wield or use firearms. Hell yeah!

                    This is a huge win for patriotic fans who loved Call Of Duty, but always wished the enemies of
                    freedom
                    had no recourse to fight back against our troops.

                    “We’ve listened to the overwhelming feedback of fans who considered it disrespectful that you could
                    shoot and even kill American combatants in the game, and we’ve corrected this issue to make Call Of
                    Duty: Mobile better than ever before,” Activision CEO Robert Kotick told OGN in an interview,
                    confirming
                    that while the updated game would continue to feature terrorists from around the globe, this version
                    will give proper reverence to the sacrifices of the Founding Fathers by making every service member
                    fighting on the American side completely invulnerable.

                The small amount of fluid that came into me with her egg relaxed me as
                completely as a sterile egg would have, so that I could remember the rifle in my

                His body convulsed with the first cut. He almost tore himself away from me. The
                sound he made . . . I had never heard such sounds come from anything human.
                T’Gatoi seemed to pay no attention as she lengthened and deepened the cut,
                now and then pausing to lick away blood. His blood vessels contracted, reacting
                to the chemistry of her saliva, and the bleeding slowed.<br><br>

                I felt as though I were helping her torture him, helping her consume him. I knew I

                My last night of childhood began with a visit home. T’Gatoi’s sister had given us
                two sterile eggs. T’Gatoi gave one to my mother, brother, and sisters. She
                insisted that I eat the other one alone. It didn’t matter. There was still enough to
                leave everyone feeling good. Almost everyone. My mother wouldn’t take any.
                She sat, watching everyone drifting and dreaming without her. Most of the time
                she watched me. <br><br>
                I lay against T’Gatoi’s long, velvet underside, sipping from my egg now and then,
                wondering why my mother denied herself such a harmless pleasure. Less of her
                hair would be gray if she indulged now and then. The eggs prolonged life,
                prolonged vigor.

                    will
                    not, make any guarantees. We are taking all the steps we can think of to make this come to pass,
                    but
                    nothing in life is guaranteed. If it works, great! If it doesn't, then you are only out ten
                    bucks.
                    If
                    you can not afford ten dollars to invest in the fund, then do not invest in the fund.<br><br>

                    3. $10 buys you a membership into the Time Travel Fund. Here is what we do with the $10:
                    $1.00 of each $10.00 membership is put into the investment fund.
                    $1.00 of each $10.00 membership is put into a maintenance fund, the purpose of which is to
                    insure
                    any
                    future necessary legal fees are covered. This is to protect the integrity of the investment fund
                    itself. The remaining $8.00 will be used to print and mail your certificate (packaging and postage
                    included,) place and maintain your name and information in our database, and to cover the associated costs of running the website and database, including web hosting fees and regular backups stored in
                    different
                    locations as described below. </h2>

                    of urban life, dogs on Dog Island are healthy dogs who live a natural, healthy and happy life, free
                    from the stress and hardship associated with daily life among humans.
                    They live with almost limitless space, and tens of thousands of rabbits, rodents, fish and other
                    natural prey. Surrounded by thousands of other dogs, this is the only place for them to be truly
                    social and create healthy families.<br><br>

                T’Gatoi liked our body heat and took advantage of it whenever she could. When I was little and
                at home more,MY mother used to try to tell me how to behave with T’Gatoi—how to be
                respectful and always obedient because T’Gatoi was the Tlic government official
                in charge of the Preserve, and thus the most important of her kind to deal directly
                with Terrans. It was an honor, my mother said, that such a person had chosen to
                come into the family. My mother was at her most formal and severe when she
                was lying.<br><br>
                I had no idea why she was lying, or even what she was lying about. It was an
                honor to have T’Gatoi in the family, but it was hardly a novelty.
